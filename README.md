This project is aimed to test my knowledge in handling the various steps involved in ETL processes. The example CSV contains dataset of metrics taken from various Arizona Coyotes
social media posts between February and March of 2021. A caveat worth mentioning is that this dataset contains simulated metrics and not a true representation of any Arizona Coyotes
social media accounts.
